## Program Overview

As Large Language Model (LLM) applications disrupt countless industries,
breakthroughs such as ChatGPT are becoming household terms. The demand for
LLM-based applications is skyrocketing, and this program will provide you with
the skills and knowledge needed to be at the forefront of this exciting field.
You will learn how you can build your own production-ready LLM-based
applications, leveraging the latest and most popular natural language
processing (NLP) frameworks.

Brought to you by the big data company that created the popular open-source
projects Apache Spark, MLflow, Delta, and Dolly, the instructors bring a unique
perspective from working with F500 companies, startups, and academia.

The first course takes you through a practical tour of how to get started
quickly with LLMs for common applications, including fine-tuning open-source
LLMs to build your own custom chat model. You will also learn how to apply
LLMOps best practices for deploying models at scale, as well as evaluate the
efficacy and bias of LLMs.

The second course dives into the details of language foundation models. You
will learn the innovations that led from LSTMs to Transformers, including BERT,
GPT, and T5, and the key breakthroughs that led to the model powering ChatGPT.

By the end of the program, you will have built your own end-to-end LLM
workflows that are ready for production. Upon completion, you will be
well-equipped to pursue careers as LLM developers, data scientists, and
engineers, and to build innovative solutions to complex natural language
processing problems.
